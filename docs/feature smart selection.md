# Feature: Smart Selection & OCR Context

## Goal
Enhance the text correction workflow by allowing users to provide visual context through screenshots and OCR-processed text selections.

## Requirements

### 1. Screenshot Capture
- Capture screenshots directly from the application
- Allow selection of specific areas of the screen
- Support for multiple screenshots as context
- Basic image annotation capabilities

### 2. OCR Processing
- Extract text from captured screenshots
- Maintain layout information where relevant
- Support different OCR modes (accuracy vs. speed)
- Handle multi-column text and complex layouts

### 3. Context Integration
- Include screenshot content as context for AI processing
- Allow mixing of text selection and OCR text
- Provide clear indication of what context is being used
- Support removing specific context elements

### 4. UI Integration
- Seamless integration with Quick Actions feature
- Simple keyboard shortcuts for capture
- Visual indication of captured areas
- Preview of OCR results before sending

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Screenshot Functionality
1. Implement screenshot capture mechanism
   - System-wide screen capture
   - Area selection overlay
   - Capture trigger hotkeys

2. Create screenshot management
   - Temporary storage
   - Preview interface
   - Basic organization

### Phase 2: OCR Integration
1. Implement OCR processing
   - Select OCR engine/library
   - Text extraction pipeline
   - Format preservation

2. Create context assembly system
   - Combine selected text with OCR text
   - Manage context metadata
   - Handle multiple context sources

### Phase 3: UI Integration
1. Develop integrated capture UI
   - Selection rectangle
   - Multi-monitor support
   - Capture confirmation

2. Build context management interface
   - Context preview
   - Edit/remove capabilities
   - Context organization

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Add image annotation
   - Basic drawing tools
   - Highlight areas of interest
   - Text annotations

2. Implement layout-aware processing
   - Table detection
   - Column recognition
   - Structure preservation

## Technical Design

### Screenshot Capture System
```
ScreenCaptureService
 ├── CaptureManager
 │    ├── MonitorInfo
 │    └── CaptureArea
 ├── SelectionOverlay
 └── ImageStorage
```

### OCR Integration
```
OcrService
 ├── TextExtractor
 ├── LayoutAnalyzer
 └── FormatPreserver

ContextManager
 ├── ContextSource
 │    ├── TextSelection
 │    ├── ScreenshotContext
 │    └── OcrContext
 └── ContextAssembler
```

## Next Steps
1. Research available OCR libraries compatible with .NET
2. Create prototype for screen area selection
3. Design screenshot capture workflow
4. Develop integration points with Quick Actions feature

# Technical Architecture: LangChain Integration & Pyramidal Email Feature

## 1. Core Integration Strategy

### 1.1 Hybrid Chain-Agent Architecture
- **Chains**: Fast, reliable transformations for 95% of use cases
- **Agents**: Complex decision-making and quality assurance for edge cases
- **Memory System**: User patterns, application context, learning data

### 1.2 Provider Management
- Automatic LLM routing based on task complexity
- Context-aware provider selection (Claude for creative, GPT for technical)
- Application detection (Outlook/Word/Chat) with context adaptation

## 2. Pyramidal Email Structuring Implementation

### 2.1 Multi-Stage Processing Pipeline
```
Input Email → Analysis Chain → Structure Chain → Subject Chain → Validation → Output
                                                                    ↓ (Fail)
                                             Agent Quality Assurance → Smart Retry
```

### 2.2 Chain Breakdown
**Analysis Chain**: Language detection, content extraction, intent analysis
**Structure Chain**: MECE hierarchy creation, substantive headings, bullet organization  
**Subject Chain**: Template-based `[Main] | [Details] | [Actions] | [@Persons]` format
**Validation Chain**: Pyramidal compliance, language consistency checking

### 2.3 Smart Retry with Agents
- **Failure Analysis**: Agent identifies specific structural issues
- **Adaptive Strategy**: Different approaches based on failure type
- **Context-Aware Prompts**: Inject relevant examples and rules for retry
- **Learning Loop**: Store successful patterns for future use

## 3. Visual Debugging & History System

### 3.1 Execution Tracking
```csharp
public class ExecutionHistory
{
    public List<ProcessingStep> Steps { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, object> StateSnapshots { get; set; }
    
    // Revert to any step, modify intermediate results, continue processing
    public void RevertToStep(int stepIndex);
    public void ModifyStepOutput(int stepIndex, object newOutput);
}
```

### 3.2 UI Components
- **Step Tree View**: Visual pipeline showing each transformation stage
- **Diff Viewer**: Input/output comparison for each step
- **Interactive State Editor**: Modify intermediate results
- **Performance Monitor**: Timing, token usage, model performance

### 3.3 Advanced Debugging Features
- **Branch Exploration**: Try alternative paths from any decision point
- **Real-time Processing**: Live view of current AI operations
- **Export/Import**: Save debugging sessions for analysis

## 4. Memory & Learning Architecture

### 4.1 Multi-layered Memory
- **Session Memory**: Current conversation context
- **User Memory**: Personal writing patterns and preferences
- **Application Memory**: Context-specific rules and formatting
- **Knowledge Base**: Examples, templates, validation rules

### 4.2 Adaptive Learning
- Pattern recognition for user-specific improvements
- Success/failure analysis for prompt optimization
- Cross-user learning (anonymized) for system improvements

## 5. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 sprints)

## 6. Key Technical Decisions

### 6.1 Architecture Patterns
- **Sequential Chains**: For predictable transformations
- **Conditional Routing**: Chain → Agent based on complexity
- **State Immutability**: Enable revert/replay functionality
- **Provider Abstraction**: Easy switching between LLM providers

### 6.2 Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of expensive components
- Efficient state management and caching
- Fallback to simpler methods on failure
- Async processing with progress tracking

### 6.3 Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when advanced features fail
- Comprehensive logging for production debugging
- User-friendly error messages with suggested actions

## 7. Success Metrics

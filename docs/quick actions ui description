# UX Design Description: Quick Actions Interface

see the ![Quick Actions Doodle](quick%20actions%20doodle.png)

## Overview
The Quick Actions interface provides a lightweight, keyboard-navigable menu system that appears when users invoke text enhancement features. This design emphasizes speed and minimal workflow disruption while offering powerful text manipulation capabilities.

## Design Principles
- **Minimal Interaction Cost**: Users can access sophisticated AI features with minimal keystrokes
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Options are organized hierarchically to reduce cognitive load
- **Keyboard-First Navigation**: All functions are accessible via keyboard shortcuts for maximum efficiency
- **Non-Disruptive**: The interface appears near the selected text without obscuring content
- **Context-Preserving**: Original text remains visible during enhancement operations

## Interface Components

### 1. Text Display Panel
- Shows original and AI-enhanced text in a compact, side-by-side format
- Highlights key changes through subtle formatting
- Includes an "Enter" button to apply changes
- Preserves context by keeping the original text visible during decision-making

### 2. Hierarchical Navigation System
- **Numbered Navigation**: Each option has a numeric shortcut for quick keyboard access
- **Drill-Down Architecture**: Options are organized in logical categories with sub-options
- **Visual Clustering**: Related options are visually grouped for intuitive navigation

### 3. Primary Enhancement Categories
- **Structural Improvements** (1): Enhances paragraph and sentence structure
- **Format Options**: Choose between formal (2) or informal (3) tones, with style variations (1')
- **Grammar Enhancements** (1): General grammar corrections with custom rule sets (2)
- **Translation Options** (3): Convert text between languages, with quick access to common languages like English (1) and German (2)

### 4. Interaction Flow
1. User selects text in any application
2. User triggers Quick Actions with keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+G)
3. Quick Actions interface appears with initial AI enhancement
4. User can navigate options using number keys to refine results
5. User presses Enter to apply changes or Escape to cancel

### 5. Visual Language
- **Bubble Containers**: Soft, rounded shapes create a friendly, approachable interface
- **Hierarchical Layout**: Options cascade in a logical, spatial organization
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Clean design with focus on content rather than UI decoration
- **Keyboard-Centric Design**: All interactive elements have clear keyboard shortcuts

## Accessibility Considerations
- All functions accessible via keyboard shortcuts
- Clear visual organization for users with cognitive disabilities
- Simple navigation patterns that are easy to learn and remember
- High-contrast text options for readability

## Future UX Enhancements
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts for frequently used enhancements
- User-definable quick action categories
- Progress indicator for longer AI operations
- Undo history with multiple levels
- Favorites system for commonly used enhancements
- Context-aware suggestions based on application type

This UX design creates a fluid, efficient interface that allows users to harness AI text enhancements with minimal friction, supporting the core product promise of making powerful AI writing assistance "just a keyboard shortcut away."

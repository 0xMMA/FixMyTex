### Integration with Action System

These role and goal contexts could be integrated in several ways:

1. **As Initial Context Setting**
   - Before showing the action menu, prompt for:
     - "Who is this for?" (Role selection)
     - "What's your goal?" (Purpose selection)
   - Then customize available actions based on these choices

2. **As Specialized Transformation Actions**
   - Add a new top-level action category:
     ```
     Context Adaptation (6)
     ├── Adapt for Audience (1)
     │   ├── Boss/Management (1)
     │   ├── Colleagues (2)
     │   ├── Team Members (3)
     │   ├── Customers (4)
     │   └── General Public (5)
     └── Adapt for Purpose (2)
         ├── Get Action (1)
         ├── Inform (2)
         ├── Train/Explain (3)
         ├── Document (4)
         └── Build Relationship (5)
     ```

3. **As Smart Presets/Templates**
   - Offer context-aware quick chains:
     - "Update for Boss": Summarize + Highlight Key Points + Formal Style
     - "Training Material": Structure Clearly + Explain Terms + Add Examples
     - "Customer Communication": Friendly Tone + Clear Action Items + Professional Style

### Menu Tree with Role/Goal Integration

Here's how it could fit into the broader menu structure:

```
Quick Actions Menu
├── Fix (1) [Basic improvements]
├── Style (2) [Tone/voice changes]
├── Transform (3) [Fundamental changes]
├── Extract (4) [Pull specific elements]
├── Analyze (5) [Provide insights]
└── Contextualize (6) [Adapt for audience/purpose]
    ├── For Audience (1)
    │   ├── Management/Boss (1)
    │   ├── Colleagues (2)
    │   ├── Clients/Customers (3)
    │   └── General Public (4)
    └── For Purpose (2)
        ├── Get Action/Decision (1)
        ├── Inform/Update (2)
        ├── Explain/Train (3)
        ├── Document/Record (4)
        └── Persuade/Convince (5)
```

### Smart Combinations and Recommendations

The system could intelligently suggest combinations based on the context:

1. **For Boss Communications**:
   - Recommended: Summarize + Action Items at Top + Formal Style
   - Chain: Extract Key Points → Restructure (Pyramid) → Style Formal

2. **For Customer Support**:
   - Recommended: Clear Instructions + Friendly Tone + Simple Language
   - Chain: Simplify → Style Friendly → Format Steps Clearly

3. **For Technical Documentation**:
   - Recommended: Precise Language + Structured Format + Definition Highlights
   - Chain: Fix Technical Terms → Extract Definitions → Convert to Markdown

4. **For Meeting Minutes**:
   - Recommended: Action Items Extraction + Clean Formatting + Timeline Clarity
   - Chain: Extract Actions → Extract Decisions → Format as Minutes

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Context Memory**
   - Remember frequent context combinations for specific applications
   - Learn user preferences for different recipients/purposes

2. **Smart Default Suggestions**
   - Analyze text to guess the likely audience and purpose
   - Suggest appropriate context settings based on content

3. **UI Presentation**
   - Could show as a "quick setup" before the main action menu:
     ```
     [For: Boss] [Purpose: Decision] → [Now choose action...]
     ```
   - Or integrate into the existing menu as additional modifiers

4. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Start with simpler actions for new users
   - Reveal context/role/goal options as users become more experienced

A desktop application that enhances your writing with AI-powered grammar, style, and text improvements - just a keyboard shortcut away.
Tired of writing professional emails? Look no further.

## Features

* **Instant Text Enhancement**: Press Ctrl+G to improve any selected text.
* **Assistant for Professional Emails**: Press Ctrl+G twice to elevate any prewritten text to professional email quality.
* **Multiple AI Providers**: Supports OpenAI, Claude, Ollama, AWS Bedrock (planned: Azure OpenAI).
* **Global Hotkeys**: Operates across all applications with customizable keyboard shortcuts.
* **Minimal UI**: Runs in the background, minimally interrupting your workflow.
* **System Tray Integration**: Option to start minimized in the system tray.
* **Automatic Updates**: Automatically checks for and installs updates directly within the application.
* **Protects Your API Keys**: Secrets are securely stored in the System Credential Manager.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Windows operating system
- API key for at least one of the supported AI services (Anthropic, OpenAI, AWS Bedrock), or an Ollama installation

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/0xMMA/FixMyTex/releases) page
   - Or build from source (see [Build Instructions](#build-instructions))
2. Launch the application 
3. Configure API keys, models and providers

### Usage

1. Select text in any application
2. Press `Ctrl+G` 
3. Wait a moment for the AI to process
4. Your text will be replaced with the improved version

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/0xMMA/FixMyTex.git
cd FixMyTex

# Install frontend dependencies
cd src/frontend
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd ../backend
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run tauri:dev

# Build for production
npm run tauri:build
```

The build output will be located in `src/backend/src-tauri/target/release`.

### Versioning

This project uses a centralized versioning system with a single source of truth:

1. The `version.json` file in the root directory contains the current version number
2. The `update-version.js` script automatically updates all version references in the project
3. NPM scripts are provided for easy version management:

```bash
# Update all version references from version.json
npm run update-version

# Increment patch version (e.g., 2.0.0 -> 2.0.1)
npm run version:patch

# Increment minor version (e.g., 2.0.0 -> 2.1.0)
npm run version:minor

# Increment major version (e.g., 2.0.0 -> 3.0.0)
npm run version:major

# Build with automatic version synchronization
npm run build
```

When creating a new release, simply run one of the version increment commands and then build:

```bash
npm run version:patch  # or version:minor or version:major
npm run build
```

This ensures that all version references in the project (frontend, backend, and Tauri configuration) are synchronized automatically.

### CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

- **Build and Test**: Automatically builds and tests the application on every push and PR
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Performs code quality and security analysis
- **Release Workflow**: Creates draft releases with Windows binaries when version tags are pushed

> **Note:** Update the repository URL in the README badges after forking this repository

To create a new release:
1. Update the version using one of the version commands:
   ```bash
   npm run version:patch  # or version:minor or version:major
   ```
2. Commit the changes to version.json and other updated files
3. Push a tag with the format `v*` matching the new version (e.g., `v2.0.1`)
   ```bash
   git tag v2.0.1
   git push origin v2.0.1
   ```
4. The release workflow will create a draft release with Windows binaries
5. Review and publish the release
